# Hi, I'm Jax Wysong

I am a MS student in Mathematics at South Dakota State University working on 
high-performance computing, numerical PDEs, and computational physics. I hope to be in a PhD program starting Fall 2026 where I can continue studying physics!

My current research focuses on:
- Space-time finite element method implementation
- Nonlinear PDE systems with ghost fields, (1+1) and (2+1)
- Parallel numerical solvers using PETSc (DMDA, SNES)

My future work entails:
- Developing a physics-aware preconditioner compatible with the nonlinear ghost system that will allow for computationally cheaper solves, making (3+1) simulations more feasible
- Using this framework to guide undergraduates interested in computational physics to pursue other projects

In the past, I worked on
- Plasma physics & magnetic reconnection (LANL Computational Physics Workshop)
- Magnetic materials and Heusler alloys (undergraduate experimental materials science)

## Publications
- Numerical Investigations of Stable Dynamics in the Presence of Ghosts (coming soon!)
- Multiple publications on Heusler alloys
*(See full list of publications and presentations in my CV)*

## Featured Repository
- **[Parallel Spacetime FEM Solver (1+1 and 2+1)](https://github.com/Jax-Wysong/space-time-fem)** – PETSc-based nonlinear PDE solver  
  - **Ghost Field Numerical Experiments** – code used to investigate how different initial conditions and potentials effect a ghost system of 2 scalar fields
  - **Linear Heat and Wave Eqn Problems** - linear problems used to test and understand numerical and parallel implementation
  - **Practice Problems in Numerical Relativity** - currently working to reproduce some results from literature to obtain a better grasp on NR and extend the space-time FEM to more regimes
